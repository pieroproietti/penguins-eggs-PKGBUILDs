# penguins-packs

This repository started as `penguins-eggs-pkgbuilds` and included package creation for Arch and Manjaro. Later the package creation for AlpineLinux was included, finally the rpm packages for AlmaLinux/Rock, fedora, Openmamba and OpenSuSE were included.

There is no need to use this repository for the creation of DEB packages, which is done directly from penguins-eggs, using on the source the command: `pnpm deb`
